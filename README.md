## üìã Overview

Gene Research Assistant is an AI-powered application that helps individuals understand scientific literature related to specific genes, genetic variants (SNPs), and nutritional supplements. The tool bridges the gap between complex scientific research and personal health insights by:

- Retrieving relevant scientific papers from NCBI databases
- Processing and analyzing paper content with AI
- Providing personalized, accessible interpretations of genetic information
- Translating complex scientific findings into practical health insights
- Offering supplement research based on scientific literature

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI and NCBI (optional for NCBI, but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gene-research-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NCBI_EMAIL=your_email@example.com  # Required for NCBI E-utilities
   NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key     # Optional but recommended
   ```

### Running the Application

Launch the interactive web interface:
```bash
streamlit run Genes.py
```

## üìñ How to Use
