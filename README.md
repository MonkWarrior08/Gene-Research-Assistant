## 📋 Overview

Gene Research Assistant is an AI-powered application that helps individuals understand scientific literature related to specific genes and genetic variants (SNPs). The tool bridges the gap between complex scientific research and personal genetic insights by:

- Retrieving relevant scientific papers from NCBI databases
- Processing and analyzing paper content with AI
- Providing personalized, accessible interpretations of genetic information
- Translating complex scientific findings into practical health insights

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Research Paper Analysis
- **Gene-specific searches**: Find papers related to a particular gene or SNP
- **Comprehensive paper details**: View titles, authors, journals, publication dates, and full abstracts
- **Efficient filtering**: Organize research findings by relevance

### 🧠 AI-Powered Genetic Insights
- **Personal genetic insights**: Understand what your genes mean for your health and traits
- **Practical applications**: Get actionable lifestyle recommendations based on genetic information
- **SNP profile analysis**: Learn specific implications of your genetic variants
- **Plain language explanations**: Complex scientific concepts explained in accessible terms

### 🛠️ Technical Capabilities
- **NCBI Integration**: Direct access to PubMed and other scientific databases
- **Real-time analysis**: Generate insights on-demand from the latest research
- **User-friendly interface**: Simple, intuitive design for both researchers and individuals

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI and NCBI (optional for NCBI, but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gene-research-assistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   NCBI_EMAIL=your_email@example.com  # Required for NCBI E-utilities
   NCBI_API_KEY=your_ncbi_api_key     # Optional but recommended
   ```

### Running the Application

Launch the interactive web interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Enter a gene name or SNP ID**
   - Example formats: "BRCA1", "rs429358", "APOE rs429358"
   - You can also include genotype information: "APOE rs429358 TT" 

2. **Review research papers**
   - Expand paper entries to view detailed information
   - Read abstracts to understand key findings

3. **Analyze genetic insights**
   - View the AI-generated analysis for personalized information
   - Learn about practical applications for your health
